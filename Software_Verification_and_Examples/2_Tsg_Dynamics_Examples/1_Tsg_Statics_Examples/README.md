This folder has six statics examples. 
1.  '01_tower' is the static analysis of a two-layer tensegrity prism in compression and tension force on the three top nodes.
2.  '02_3D_Dbar' is the pseudo-static analysis of a 3D_Dbar with rest length changing.
3. '03_lander' is the static analysis of an expanded octahedron tensegrity with the rest length of one string changing.
4. '04_Jasen_linkage' is a pseudo-static analysis of a truss system, Jasen linkage. The Jasen linkage is actuated by the forced motion of some nodes.
5. '05_cable_dome' is the static analysis of a Levy cable dome in vertical load exerting on each top node.
6. '06_half_Tbar' is the static analysis of a very simple structure, half_Tbar. A horizontal force is exerted on the top nodes, and the one string will slack.
